This short project was created for the Bridges To Wealth (B2W) Student Real Estate Team. THe B2W Real Estate Team is a multi-school team that was created as part of the Entrepreneurship section of B2W. These students collect data on different houses, will aim to draw conclusions and make informed decisions on which property to select, bid on it and then do the appropriate constructions to finally resell the house. This project aims to teach students financial planning, independence and data-driving decision making as this piece of code helps to create the foundation for the students to then build on.
